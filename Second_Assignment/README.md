### This is the Second assignment of the Degree Embedded system design and microcontroller applications for the Internet of Things.
The assignment consist of four parts.
* Eight-LED sequential control circuit with Quartus.
It is going to be externally controlled by me via the GPIOs The GPIO[1] for example will be the reset and the GPIO[0] will be the signal.

* Implement the circuit to represent the hexadecimal value corresponding to the sum of all digits representing the input of the GPIO [3: 0] at the 7-segment display.
